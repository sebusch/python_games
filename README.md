# Python games

I have written 2 Python games (Hangman, and Rock Paper Scissors) in response to this promt from my class: 

> As we end PYTHON 1, this session gives us the opportunity to practice programming in a creative manner. Programming is not (only) about learning facts but learning from the experience of creating something. 
>
> Programming can be a very creative pursuit. This session gives us the chance to put our knowledge into practice by building a simple toy.
>
>The objective for this session is to build a fun toy with the information you have learned so far. 

To play hangman:
```
$ python3 PYTHON-1-hangman.py
```

To play Rock, Paper, Scissorys:
```
$ python3 PYTHON-1-rockpaperscissors.py
```
